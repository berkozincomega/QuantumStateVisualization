# Quantum State Simulation

This project simulates the transition of a Spin-1 atom from an excited state to a Spin-0 ground state, calculating the probabilities of emitting right-handed and left-handed circularly polarized photons.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Mathematica
- **Tools**: GitHub, Mathematica (Wolfram), etc.
